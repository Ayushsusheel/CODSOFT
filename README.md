__Hi Everyone,__ 

* This repository consists of the projects that were assigned to me during my "__Internship__" at __CODSOFT.__


=============================================================================================

 (___Task-1 "DEVELOP A NUMBER GUESSING GAME___)


 * In my task 1 I used Math.random() function which basically generates any random number.
 * Then calling a method playGame() inside which all the logic have been written like how to take user name as an input, prompt the user to select the level as EASY/MEDIUM/HARD.
 * In the easy level the user can play/guess the number till 10 times means he/she has total 10 chances.
 * In Medium level he has 5 chances
 * In Hrad level he has only 2 chances.
 * And based on the number of chances used a total score is calculated and displayed to user :-)
 * Also the user gets an option that he/she wants to play the game again or not!
 * If yes then simply press 9 else 0 for exit.

(___Task-2 "DEVELOP A WORD COUNTER APP___)

 
* Prompt the user to enter a text or provide a file to count the words.
* Read the input text or file and store it in a string.
* Split the string into an array of words using space or punctuation as delimiters.
* Initialize a counter variable to keep track of the number of words.
* Iterate through the array of words and increment the counter for each word encountered.
* Display the total count of words to the user.
* So, I have done this using the Spring MVC framework and Spring ORM (HIBERNATE) , for the frontend I used JSP,CSS and for the Database part I used MySQL Workbench...
* So 1st of all the user will get 2 options either count the number of words in a text file or count the number of words on the website itself.
* If the user selects/press on the button [VIA-TEXT] so the user is redirected to a page where he will simply write the text/any amount of data he/she can write then after clicking on the 
   submit button a success page is displayed with the total number of words count :-)
* Similarly the [VIA-FILE] works where he is given an option to choose a file and simply hit the button "UPLOAD". The user after clicking on the 
    submit button a success page is displayed with the total number of words count :-)

(___Task-3 DEVELOP A STUDENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM___)

 
* Create a Student class to represent individual students. Include attributes such as name, roll number, grade, and any other relevant details.
* Implement a StudentManagementSystem class to manage the collection of students. 
* Include methods to add a student, remove a student, search for a student, and display all students. 
* Implement methods to read and write student data to a storage medium, such as a file or a database.
* Allow users to interact with the Student Management System by providing options such as
* adding a new student, editing an existing student's information, searching for a student, displaying all students, and exiting the application.
* Implement input validation to ensure that required fields are not left empty and that the student data is in the correct format
* All the requirements I have done successfully in my spring mvc web-app, which I have done this using the Spring MVC framework and Spring ORM (HIBERNATE) , for the frontend I used JSP,CSS 
  and for the Database part I used MySQL Workbench... 
* The user can perform all the basic CRUD opeations
* The form validations have also been taken care of means if I'm not entering the student name then the error is shown as:- THE NAME CANNOT BE EMPTY for all the fields like name,age,rollnumber,
   dob,phoneNumber,subjects etc for all the fields I have created the form Validations!!
* Also I used the concept of Java Mail Sender in which the admin of the website have to simply provide 2 details 1:-USERNAME, 2:-USER EMAIL-ID.
* Simply click on the [send-email] button then a email is sent to that partiular user which comprises of all the details of the students that have been added so far  : - )
