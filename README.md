Hi Everyone, 

* This repository consists of the projects that were assigned to me during my "Internship" at CODSOFT.


=================================================================================================================================================================================================

============================================
||* Task-1 "DEVELOP A NUMBER GUESSING GAME ||
============================================

  In my task 1 I used Math.random() function which basically generates any random number.
  Then calling a method playGame() inside which all the logic have been written like how to take user name as an input, prompt the user to select the level as EASY/MEDIUM/HARD.
  In the easy level the user can play/guess the number till 10 times means he/she has total 10 chances.
  In Medium level he has 5 chances
  In Hrad level he has only 2 chances.
  And based on the number of chances used a total score is calculated and displayed to user :-)
  Also the user gets an option that he/she wants to play the game again or not!
  If yes then simply press 9 else 0 for exit.

||* Task-2 "DEVELOP A WORD COUNTER APP"   ||
============================================
 
Prompt the user to enter a text or provide a file to count the words.
2. Read the input text or file and store it in a string.
3. Split the string into an array of words using space or punctuation as delimiters.
4. Initialize a counter variable to keep track of the number of words.
5. Iterate through the array of words and increment the counter for each word encountered.
6. Display the total count of words to the user.
7. So, I have done this using the Spring MVC framework and Spring ORM (HIBERNATE) , for the frontend I used JSP,CSS and for the Database part I used MySQL Workbench...
8. So 1st of all the user will get 2 options either count the number of words in a text file or count the number of words on the website itself.
9. If the user selects/press on the button [VIA-TEXT] so the user is redirected to a page where he will simply write the text/any amount of data he/she can write then after clicking on the 
   submit button a success page is displayed with the total number of words count :-)
10. Similarly the [VIA-FILE] works where he is given an option to choose a file and simply hit the button "UPLOAD". The user after clicking on the 
    submit button a success page is displayed with the total number of words count :-)

||* Task-3 "DEVELOP A STUDENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM"   ||
=====================================================

 
* Create a Student class to represent individual students. Include attributes such as name, roll number, grade, and any other relevant details.
* Implement a StudentManagementSystem class to manage the collection of students. 
* Include methods to add a student, remove a student, search for a student, and display all students. 
* Implement methods to read and write student data to a storage medium, such as a file or a database.
* Allow users to interact with the Student Management System by providing options such as
* adding a new student, editing an existing student's information, searching for a student, displaying all students, and exiting the application.
* Implement input validation to ensure that required fields are not left empty and that the student data is in the correct format
* All the requirements I have done successfully in my spring mvc web-app, which I have done this using the Spring MVC framework and Spring ORM (HIBERNATE) , for the frontend I used JSP,CSS 
  and for the Database part I used MySQL Workbench... 
* The user can perform all the basic CRUD opeations
* The form validations have also been taken care of means if I'm not entering the student name then the error is shown as:- THE NAME CANNOT BE EMPTY for all the fields like name,age,rollnumber,
   dob,phoneNumber,subjects etc for all the fields I have created the form Validations!!
* Also I used the concept of Java Mail Sender in which the admin of the website have to simply provide 2 details 1:-USERNAME, 2:-USER EMAIL-ID.
* Simply click on the [send-email] button then a email is sent to that partiular user which comprises of all the details of the students that have been added so far  : - )
